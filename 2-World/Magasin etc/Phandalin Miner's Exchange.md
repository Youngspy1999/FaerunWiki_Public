# `=this.file.name`
## Overview
The company would purchase quantities of ore and gems from the miners of Phandalin. Each piece was carefully measured and weighed, and then its price was determined. In addition, the Exchange had a wide variety of goods for sale, including some illicit goods for those on friendly terms with the guildmaster. It was also the best place to purchase carts and wagons in Phandalin.
It further functioned as a records office, which registered claims to specific parts of the land, such as valleys, streams, and excavations.

The exchange was located to the southwest of Phandalin, and directly east of a trail used by the local miners. It was marked by a sign bearing an image of two crossed pickaxes over a lump of gold.
