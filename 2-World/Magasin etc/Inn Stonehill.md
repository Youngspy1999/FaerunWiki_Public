# `=this.file.name`
## Overview
A modest inn that was run by a short, friendly young human man named Toblen Stonehill. Toblen came from the east of Triboar, seeking opportunity in prospecting like many others. He soon found that he knew more about running an inn than mining, and so he established the inn



Narth, an old farmer: “Sister Garaele, who oversees the Shrine of Luck, recently left town for a few days, then returned wounded and exhausted.”

• Elsa, a gossipy barmaid: “Daran Edermath, the orchard keeper, is a former adventurer.” 

• Lanar, a miner: “Orcs raiders have been seen on the east end of Triboar Trail. The townmaster is looking for someone to run them off.”

• Trilena, the innkeeper’s wife: “Thel Dendrar, a local woodcarver, stood up to the Redbrands a tenday ago when they came by his shop and leered at his wife. The ruffians murdered him. Several townsfolk saw it happen. The Redbrands grabbed his body, and now his wife, daughter, and son have gone missing too.”

• Pip, Toblen’s young son: “Qelline Alderleaf s son Carp said he found a secret tunnel in the woods, but Redbrands almost caught him.”

• Freda, a weaver: “The Redbrands hassle every business in town, except for the Phandalin Miner’s Exchange. They don’t want trouble with Halia Thornton, who runs it.”
